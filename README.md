# UX Design

### Design Thinking
When I started this project, my goal was to create a film blog website that was modern and user friendly where people can review, add, delete film blogs and meet new people of the same genre/film.
* Easy access to film reviews
* A navbar to navigate through pages
* Being able to create an account and login
* A film card able to edit and delete reviews
* Add a film page

# User Stories

* Create a film review
  - As a site user I want to add my favourite films and add my personal review on the film so that I can view all the films I have watched and reviewed.
* View a film review
  - As a site user I want view films and the reviews so that I can watch them in my free time.
* Edit a film
  - As a site user I want to edit films so that I can give it my own personal opinion.
* Delete a film
  - As a site user I want to delete my review so that I can delete it if I change my decision.
* Navigation Bar
  - As a site user I want to navigate through the navbar so that I can easily navigate through the website.
* Footer Social Links
  - As a site user I can click on social links that I can follow the restaurant on various social media pages.


 ### Database Chart

 I created a chart for my CRUD functionality so I am able to use this image and chart to visualize the model I want in my project.


 # Design

* Laying out all the cards (Films) across the page so the user can easily see which films are rated and liked by other people.
*  Navbar that includes, register, login, films and add your own film.
  
## Log In Page
* In this page I want the user to be able to login to their existing account

## Add a Film

* Blue: #0d6efd;
* Black: #000;
